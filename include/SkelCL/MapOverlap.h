///
/// \brief The MapOverlap skeleton describes calculations performed on one or
///        more devices. It invokes a unary user-defined function on a container
///        in a parallel fashion. Unlike the Map skeleton the user-defined
///        function can access more than just a single element of the container.

///
/// \brief This class implements the MapOverlap skeleton, which describes
///        calculations performed on one or more devices. It invokes a unary
///        user-defined function on a container in a parallel fashion. Unlike
///        the Map skeleton the user-defined function can access more than just
///        a single element of the container.
///
/// On creation the MapOverlap skeleton is customized with source code defining
/// a unary function, an overlap range, as well as a Padding mode. The overlap
/// range specifies how many elements of the neighborhood of an element can be
/// accesses by the user-defined function. The Padding mode defines how out of
/// bound accesses are handled.
///
/// More formally: When c is a container of length n with items c[0] .. c[n-1],
/// f is the provided unary function, and r is the overlap range, the MapOverlap
/// skeleton performs the calculation f(c[i-r], .., c[i], .., c[i+r]) for
/// every i in 0 .. n-1. If an out of bound access of c occurs the Padding mode
/// defines the behavior.
///
/// As all skeletons, the MapOverlap skeleton allows for passing additional
/// arguments, i.e. arguments besides the input container, to the user defined
/// function.
/// The user-defined function has to written in such a way, that it expects more
/// than just one argument (it is no unary function any more). Accordingly the
/// number, types and order of arguments used when calling the map skeleton has
/// to match the declaration of the user-defined function.
///
/// \tparam Tin   The type of the elements stored in the input container.
/// \tparam Tout  The type of the elements stored in the output container.
