/// \class AllPairs
///
/// \brief An instance of the AllPairs skeleton describes all calculation of
///        pairs of row vectors and column vectors with a user defined function
///        which can be performed on a device.
///
/// \tparam Tleft  Type of the left input data of the skeleton
///         Tright Type of the right input data of the skeleton
///         Tout   Type of the output data of the skeleton
///
/// On creation the AllPairs skeleton is customized with either a given reduce and
/// zip skeleton or with source code defining a function. The source code function header receives
/// two vectors of the same length and the length as an integer as follows:
/// Tout func(lmatrix_t* row, rmatrix_t* col, const unsigned int dim). The i-th element of the
/// row-vector row of type lmatrix_t can be accessed via the API-Function getElementFromRow(row, i) and the i-th element of
/// the column-vector col of type rmatrix_t can be accessed via the API-function getElementFromColumn(col, i).
/// The AllPairs skeleton can then be called by passing two matrix containers.
/// The AllPairs skeleton will compute the results of all pairs of row-vectors from the left matrix
/// and column-vectors from the right matrix and store them in a result matrix.
/// More formally: When M is a matrix of size heigt x dim and N is a matrix of size dim x width
/// and F is the customized function that receives a row-vector from M and and a column-vector from N and calcutes
/// a scalar value.
/// Then P is the result matrix of size height x width.
/// Every P[i,j] is the scalar result from F(M_i, N_j), where M_i is
/// the ith row vector in M for i in [0,..,height-1] and N_j is the jth column vector in N for j
/// in [0,...,width-1].
/// When a zip and a reduce skeleton was passed, then function F = Reduce(Zip(M_i,N_j)).
/// Passing a zip and reduce skeleton yields a better runtime than defining a function as source code.
