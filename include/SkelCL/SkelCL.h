/// \section intro Introduction
///
/// This document describes SkelCL a multi-GPU skeleton library based
/// on OpenCL. It is actively developed at the University of MÃ¼nster, Germany,
/// by Michel Steuwer and others. For comments or questions feel
/// free to contact the author: <michel.steuwer@uni-muenster.de>
///
/// Most of the functionality is explained in multiple peer-reviewed
/// publications and in detail in a diploma thesis with the title:
/// "Developing a Portable Multi-GPU Skeleton Library".
///
/// Two key abstractions are made in this library: algorithmic skeletons
/// and a unified memory abstraction. This also reflects in the classes
/// described here. The Skeleton class and subclasses describe
/// calculations performed on a GPU.
/// The Container classes, like Vector provides a unified memory management
/// for CPU and GPU memory.
///
/// \section example Example
///
/// The following example shows a full functional SkelCL program.
/// The dot product of two vectors is calculated.
/// The Zip skeleton combines two vectors element-wise.
/// The Reduce skeleton reduces all elements of a vector to a single
/// value.
///
/// \code
///
 // #include <iostream>
/// #include <SkelCL/SkelCL.h>
///
/// using namespace skelcl;
///
/// int main (int argc, char const *argv[]) {
///   skelcl::init(); // Initialize SkelCL
///   // Create zip skeleton with the multiplication as operation
///   Zip<float(float)> mult("(float x, float y){ return x*y; }");
///   // Reduce skeleton requires the identity of the given operation as
///   // second argument. For the addition this is 0.
///   Reduce<float(float)> sum("(float x, float y){ return x+y; }", "0");
///
///   int size = 1024;
///   // Fill pointers a_ptr and b_ptr with random values.
///   float* a_ptr = mallocAndInit(size);
///   float* b_ptr = mallocAndInit(size);
///
///   // Create vectors A and B
///   Vector<float> A(a_ptr, a_ptr+size);
///   Vector<float> B(b_ptr, b_ptr+size);
///
///   // Execute the skeletons
///   Vector<float> C = sum( mult(A, B) );
///
///   // Access the calculated value.
///   std::cout << C.front() << std::endl;
/// }
///
/// \endcode
