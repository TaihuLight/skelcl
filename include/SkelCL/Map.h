///         This version is used when the user-function has return type void.
///
/// This is a more specialized version of the general Map<Tout(Tin)> skeleton.
/// It can be customized with a user-defined function taking an IndexPoint (a
/// pair of integer values). For this version the user-defined function must be
/// void, i.e. return nothing.
///
/// On creation the Map skeleton is customized with source code defining a
/// unary function. An instance of this class is a function object, i.e. it can
/// be called like a function. When this happens a container is passed as input
/// to the Map skeleton which then invokes the provided function on every
/// element of the container in a parallel fashion on one or more devices
/// (depending of the distribution of the container).
///
/// More formally: When c is a container of length n with items c[0] .. c[n-1],
/// and f is the provided unary function, the Map skeleton performs the
/// calculation f(x[i]) for ever i in 0 .. n-1.
///
/// As all skeletons, the Map skeleton allows for passing additional arguments,
/// i.e. arguments besides the input container, to the user defined function.
/// The user-defined function has to written in such a way, that it expects more
/// than just one argument (it is no unary function any more). Accordingly the
/// number, types and order of arguments used when calling the map skeleton has
/// to match the declaration of the user-defined function.
