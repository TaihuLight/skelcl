=============================INSTALL SkelCL====================================

Follow the steps bellow to build SkelCL.
SkelCL uses CMake as its build system and require a modern C++ compiler, since
features of the C++11 standard are used throughout the implementation.

====

Required for building SkelCL and runing are:

  - a modern C++ compiler with (at least some) C++11 support.
    Tested with GCC 4.6 and above as well as Clang 3.1 and above.

  - CMake 2.6 or above (see: http://www.cmake.org)

  - libclang, which is part of the llvm releases (see: http://llvm.org/releases)

  - a working OpenCL implementation

  - the GTest library 1.6.0 or above (see: http://code.google.com/p/googletest)

====

For building SkelCL:
 execute the build.sh file in the SkelCL root directory
 (only if you are running Ubuntu 12.04 64bit or OS X!)
OR
 follow the steps manually:

1. Checkout the SkelCL source code into an arbitrary directory, lets call it
   SKELCL_HOME

2. Download the newest llvm release from http://llvm.org/release and extract
   it in the directory:
      
  SKELCL_HOME/libraries/stooling/libraries/llvm

3. Download the newest GTest release from http://code.google.com/p/googletest
   and extract it in the directory:
      
  SKELCL_HOME/libraries/gtest

4. Now switch in the directory SKELCL_HOME and create a new build directory:

  cd SKELCL_HOME
  mkdir build
  cd build

5. Call cmake:

  cmake ..

   If you want to customize some build settings, like the used compiler, use the ccmake or cmake-gui tool to edit the CMake cache.

6. Call make (use the -j option to speed up the compilation):

  make -j4

7. Let all the tests run to verify that SkelCL was build correctly:

  make test

   It should return with 100% of the tests passing.
